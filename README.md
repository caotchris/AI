Project realized, This Project is in DataCamp

Building Multimodal AI Applications with LangChain & the OpenAI API


Videos can be full of useful information, but getting hold of that info can be slow, since you need to watch the whole thing or try skipping through it. 
It can be much faster to use a bot to ask questions about the contents of the transcript.

In this project, you'll download a tutorial video from YouTube, transcribe the audio, and create a simple Q&A bot to ask questions about the content.

* Understanding the building blocks of working with Multimodal AI projects
* Working with some of the fundamental concepts of LangChain
* How to use the Whisper API to transcribe audio to text
* How to combine both LangChain and Whisper API to create ask questions of any YouTube video
